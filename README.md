This project focuses on a dataset of patents awarded the prestigious China Patent Gold Award and contrasts these with a set of 2000 non-awarded patents. The datasets are provided in Stata data format (.dta), ready for analysis with the appropriate software.

Dataset Description
Awarded Patents Dataset: Contains details of patents that have received the China Patent Gold Award.

Non-Awarded Patents Dataset: Comprises 2000 patents that did not receive awards, serving as a comparative baseline to identify key differentiators and patterns.

Both datasets are available in .dta format which can be directly imported into Stata for comprehensive statistical analysis.

Code
Included in this repository is the source code used to compute key patent metrics, specifically:

DIV* (Diversity Index): A measure of the technological diversity embodied by each patent.
RS (Relative Specialization): An index reflecting the specialization degree in the technological domain of each patent.
The scripts are tailored to assist researchers in replicating the study or adapting the methodology to their own datasets.
